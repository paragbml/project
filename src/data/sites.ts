    detailedInfo: "The Basilica of Bom Jesus is a Roman Catholic basilica located in Goa, India. The basilica is part of the Churches and Convents of Goa UNESCO World Heritage Site. The church is located in Old Goa, which was the capital of Goa during the Portuguese rule. 'Bom Jesus' means 'Good Jesus' or 'Infant Jesus'. The basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier, who was one of the founding members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit Order). Constructed in 1605, the basilica is an outstanding example of Baroque architecture in India. The church's facade combines elements of Doric, Corinthian, and composite styles, making it a unique architectural blend. It remains one of the best examples of baroque architecture in India and is the only church in Old Goa that is not plastered on the outside."

    detailedInfo: "The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is one of the most famous Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and is located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the name Vishwanatha or Vishweshwara, meaning Ruler of the Universe. The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history. The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler, Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore in 1780. In 2019, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project was initiated to create a pathway from the temple to the Ganges River, which has transformed the area around the temple into a spacious complex with multiple facilities for pilgrims and tourists."
